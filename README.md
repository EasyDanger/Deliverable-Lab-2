# Deliverable-Lab-2

This project is Part Two of the “Deliverables” for the Grand Circus Java Bootcamp Pre-work (Unit 1). It is not meant for public consumption, though it should be able to stand up to scrutiny. 

This program is designed to accept two dates from a user’s input and print the difference between the two in years, months, and days.

The actual .java file is in the SRC folder. 

I tried to be as thorough as possible, so I welcome you to throw whatever challenges you have at this code. I believe it’s water tight, but other people can always come up with things I hadn’t thought of.

The code should be able to handle any input without crashing and burning. 

Feel free to contact me or comment on any bugs or peculiarities. 













Make art, run fast, tell stories, play.
